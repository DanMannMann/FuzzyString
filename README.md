# FuzzyString

Go to https://fuzzystring.codeplex.com/ for the home of this excellent project. I've copied it here to maintain a strongly-named copy which I need for a project where strong naming is required but I've made no substantive changes and all respect/questions should go to the original author on Codeplex.
